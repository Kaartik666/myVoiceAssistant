# myVoiceAssistant
This Python script builds a voice assistant named "Jack" using pyttsx3 for speech output and speech_recognition for voice command input. Jack can greet users, search Wikipedia, open websites like YouTube and Google, play random music from a folder, and tell the time. It's a simple, customizable assistant designed for basic tasks.
